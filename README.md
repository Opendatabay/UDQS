## Overview

UDQS is an open-source standard for evaluating and scoring data quality across different domains. It provides a comprehensive framework to assess, measure, and benchmark the quality of datasets using standardized criteria.

## Purpose

- Establish a universal standard for data quality assessment
- Enable consistent quality benchmarking across datasets
- Provide tools and templates for easy quality evaluation
- Support customisation for domain-specific requirements
- Foster transparency in data quality metrics

## Getting Started

1. Review the [parameters documentation](docs/parameters.md) to understand quality metrics
2. Choose either the PDF questionnaire or Excel template from the `templates/` directory
3. Follow the [scoring guide](docs/scoring-guide.md) to evaluate your dataset
4. Check example implementations in the `examples/` directory for reference

## Scoring System

UDQS evaluates datasets across multiple dimensions,including:

- Data Completeness
- Data Accuracy
- Data Consistency
- Data Timeliness
- Data Validity
- Documentation Quality
- Format Compliance

Each dimension is scored on a standardised scale, with detailed scoring criteria available in the scoring guide.

## Templates

- **PDF Questionnaire**: Print-friendly assessment form for manual evaluations
- **Excel Template**: An automated scoring calculator with built-in formulas
- **Example Datasets**: Sample evaluations across different domains

## Customization

UDQS can be adapted for specific domains while maintaining compatibility with the core standard. See [customization.md](docs/customization.md) for guidelines.
