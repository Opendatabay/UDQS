Creating a Data Quality Score for datasets in the marketplace involves evaluating them
based on various quality, usability and compliance aspects.

1. Data Quality (30%)
Completeness: Are there missing values? Datasets with fewer null values would score
higher.
Accuracy: Is the data accurate and reliable? Check if itâ€™s aligned with trusted sources.
Consistency: Are data values consistent across records? This includes standardized
formats, naming conventions, and data types.
Timeliness: Is the data up-to-date? Time-sensitive data should be recent or have regular
updates.
Scoring Example:
Completeness (out of 10): 9 (almost no null values)
Accuracy (out of 10): 8 (very accurate, validated with external sources)

Consistency (out of 5): 4 (few inconsistencies)
Timeliness (out of 5): 4 (recent data, updated quarterly)
Total Quality Score = 25/30
2. Data Usability (20%)
Documentation: Does the dataset come with metadata, clear descriptions, and
guidelines? Proper documentation enhances usability.
Accessibility: Is it easy to access and integrate the dataset, such as through API access or
standard formats (e.g., CSV, JSON)?
Data Enrichment: Are there additional fields that provide deeper insights or make the data
more valuable?
Scoring Example:
Documentation (out of 10): 8 (thorough descriptions, clear field explanations)
Accessibility (out of 5): 4 (API access provided)
Data Enrichment (out of 5): 3 (some additional fields but not exhaustive)
Total Usability Score = 15/20
3. Data Relevance (15%)
Fit for Purpose: Is the data relevant to a specific use case or target audience? A dataset for
marketing might need demographics, while a financial dataset needs transaction details.
Coverage: How broadly does the data cover the necessary aspects for the intended use?
Scoring Example:
Fit for Purpose (out of 10): 7 (general but useful for multiple cases)
Coverage (out of 5): 4 (covers key fields but lacks niche details)
Total Relevance Score = 11/15
4. Data Compliance & Security (20%)
Anonymization & Privacy: Is personally identifiable information (PII) protected and
anonymized? High scores go to datasets that securely handle sensitive data.

Data Governance: Is the data compliant with relevant regulations like GDPR or HIPAA?
Scoring Example:
Anonymization & Privacy (out of 10): 9 (fully anonymized)
Data Governance (out of 10): 8 (compliant with GDPR)
Total Compliance & Security Score = 17/20
5. Data Value & Popularity (15%)
Demand/Popularity: Is this dataset widely used or requested? Popular datasets add higher
value to the marketplace.
Impact Potential: How valuable is the data for making strategic decisions or gaining
insights?
Scoring Example:
Demand/Popularity (out of 10): 6 (moderately popular)
Impact Potential (out of 5): 4 (useful for predictive modeling in specific cases)
Total Value & Popularity Score = 10/15

Final Score Calculation
Combine these weighted scores to get an overall score from 1 to 100.
For example:
Final Score=(25+15+11+17+10)=78/100
